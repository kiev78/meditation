          The refuges in Buddhism, both on the internal and on the external levels, are the Buddha,
          Dharma, and Sangha, also known as the Triple Gem. To take refuge in the Buddha means, not
          taking refuge in him as a person, but taking refuge in the fact of his Awakening: placing
          trust in the belief that he did awaken to the truth, that he did so by developing
          qualities that we too can develop, and that the truths to which he awoke provide the best
          perspective for the conduct of our life. The Dharma, on the external level, refers to the
          path of practice the Buddha taught to his followers: The words of his teachings, the act
          of putting those teachings into practice, and the attainment of Awakening as the result of
          that practice. The Sangha consists of all people, lay or ordained, who have practiced the
          Dharma to the point of gaining at least a glimpse of the Deathless. – From Commentary by
          Thanissaro Bhikkhu

        <strong>The Heart Sutra – Tibetan Longer Version</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Thus have I heard: Once the Blessed One was dwelling in Rajagriha at Vulture Peak Mountain
        with a great gathering of monks, nuns and Bodhisattvas. At that time the Blessed One entered
        the samadhi that expresses the dharma called “Profound Illumination.” At the same time,
        noble Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva Mahasattva, while engaging in the profound
        transcendent wisdom, clearly saw the five skandhas to be empty of nature. Then, through the
        inspiration of the Buddha, venerable Shariputra said to noble Avalokiteshvara, the
        Bodhisattva Mahasattva, “How should a son or daughter of noble family train, who wishes to
        follow the profound path of transcendent wisdom?”<br />Then noble Avalokiteshvara, a
        Bodhisattva Mahasattva, said to venerable Shariputra: “O Shariputra, a son or daughter of
        noble family who wishes to follow the profound path of transcendent wisdom should see in
        this way: See the five skandhas to be empty of nature. Form is emptiness. Emptiness is form.
        Emptiness is no other than form; form is no other than emptiness. In the same way, feeling,
        perception, formation, and consciousness are emptiness.<br />“Thus, Shariputra, all
        phenomena are emptiness. They have no characteristics. There is no birth and no cessation.
        There is no impurity and no purity. There is no decrease and no increase. Therefore,
        Shariputra, in emptiness, there is no form, no feeling, no perception, no formation, no
        consciousness; no eye, no ear, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind; no appearance, no
        sound, no smell, no taste, no touch, no phenomena; no quality of sight, and so on until no
        quality of thought and no quality of mind-consciousness; no ignorance, no end of ignorance
        up to no old age and death, no end of old age and death; no suffering, no cause of
        suffering, no cessation of suffering and no path; no wisdom, no attainment and no
        non-attainment. Therefore, Shariputra, since the Bodhisattvas have no attainment, they abide
        by means of transcendent wisdom. Since there is no obscuration of mind, there is no fear.
        They transcend falsity and attain complete nirvana, passing beyond the bounds of sorrow. All
        the Buddhas of the three times, by means of transcendent wisdom, fully and<br />clearly
        awaken to unsurpassable, true, complete enlightenment. Therefore, the great mantra of
        transcendent wisdom, the mantra of great insight, the unsurpassed mantra, the mantra that
        equals the unequaled, the mantra that calms all suffering, should be known as truth, since
        there is no deception. The mantra of transcendent wisdom is said in this way: <br />‘OM GATE
        GATE PARAGATE PARASAMGATE BODHI SVAHA’<br />“Thus, Shariputra, the Bodhisattva Mahasattvas
        should train in the profound<br />transcendent wisdom.” Then the Blessed One arose from that
        samadhi and praised noble Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva Mahasattva, saying, “Good, good.
        Thus it is, O son of noble family, thus it is. One should practice the profound transcendent
        wisdom just as you have taught and all the Tathagatas will rejoice.” When the Blessed One
        had said this, venerable Shariputra and noble Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva Mahasattva,
        that whole assembly and the world with its gods, humans, asuras and gandharvas, rejoiced and
        praised the words of the Blessed One.

      <p>
        When the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara was coursing in the deep prajnaparamita, <br />he
        perceived that all five skandhas are empty, thereby transcending all sufferings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sariputra, form is not other than emptiness and emptiness not other than form.<br />Form is
        precisely emptiness and emptiness precisely form.<br />So also are sensation, perception,
        volition, and consciousness.<br />Sariputra, this voidness of all dharmas is not born, not
        destroyed, <br />not impure, not pure, does not increase or decrease.
      </p>
      <p>
        In voidness there is no form, and no sensation, <br />perception, volition or
        consciousness;<br />no eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind;<br />no sight, sound, smell,
        taste, touch, thought;<br />there is no realm of the eye, all the way up to no realm of

          There is no ignorance and there is no ending of ignorance,<br />through to no aging and

          no cessation of suffering, and no path.<br />There is no wisdom or any attainment.<br />With
          nothing to attain, bodhisattvas relying on prajnaparamita have no obstructions in their
          minds.<br />Having no obstructions, there is no fear and departing far from confusion and
          imagining, they reach ultimate nirvana.<br /><br />All past, present and future Buddhas,
          <br />relying on prajnaparamita, attain anuttara-samyak-sambodhi.<br />Therefore, know
          that prajnaparamita is the great mantra of power, <br />the great mantra of wisdom, the
          supreme mantra, the unequalled mantra, <br />which is able to remove all sufferings. It is
          real and not false.<br />Therefore, recite the mantra of prajnaparamita:<br /><br />Gate,

        <strong>The Insight that Brings Us to the Other Shore</strong> by Thich Nhat Hanh
      </h2>
      <p>
        Avalokiteshvara, while practicing deeply with the Insight that Brings Us to the Other Shore,
        suddenly discovered that all of the five Skandhas are equally empty, and with this
        realization he overcame all Ill-being. “Listen Sariputra, this Body itself is Emptiness and
        Emptiness itself is this Body. This Body is not other than Emptiness and Emptiness is not
        other than this Body. The same is true of Feelings, Perceptions, Mental Formations, and
        Consciousness. Listen Sariputra, all phenomena bear the mark of Emptiness; their true nature
        is the nature of no Birth no Death, no Being no Non-being, no Defilement no Purity, no
        Increasing no Decreasing. That is why in Emptiness, Body, Feelings, Perceptions, Mental
        Formations and Consciousness are not separate self-entities. The Eighteen Realms of
        Phenomena which are the six Sense Organs, the six Sense Objects, and the six Consciousnesses
        are also not separate self-entities. The Twelve Links of Interdependent Arising and their
        Extinction are also not separate self-entities. Ill-being, the Causes of Ill-being, the End
        of Ill-being, the Path, insight and attainment, are also not separate self-entities. Whoever
        can see this no longer needs anything to attain. Bodhisattvas who practice the Insight that
        Brings Us to the Other Shore see no more obstacles in their mind, and because there are no
        more obstacles in their mind, they can overcome all fear, destroy all wrong perceptions and
        realize Perfect Nirvana. All Buddhas in the past, present and future by practicing the
        Insight that Brings Us to the Other Shore are all capable of attaining Authentic and Perfect
        Enlightenment. Therefore Sariputra, it should be known that the Insight that Brings Us to
        the Other Shore is a Great Mantra, the most illuminating mantra, the highest mantra, a
        mantra beyond compare, the True Wisdom that has the power to put an end to all kinds of
        suffering. Therefore let us proclaim a mantra to praise the Insight that Brings Us to the
        Other Shore. Gate, Gate, Paragate, Parasamgate, Bodhi Svaha! Gate, Gate, Paragate,
        Parasamgate, Bodhi Svaha! Gate, Gate, Paragate, Parasamgate, Bodhi Svaha!

        <strong>The Identity of Relative and Absolute (Sandōkai)</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        The mind of the Great Sage of India was intimately conveyed from west to east.<br />
        Among human beings are wise ones and fools, But in the Way there is no northern or southern
        Patriarch.
      </p>
      <p>
        The subtle source is clear and bright; the tributary streams flow through the darkness. To
        be attached to things is illusion; to encounter the absolute is not yet enlightenment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each and all, the subjective and objective spheres are related and at the same time,
        independent. Related, yet working differently, though each keeps its own place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Form makes the character and appearance different; Sounds distinguish comfort and
        discomfort. The dark makes all words one; the brightness distinguishes good and bad phrases.
      </p>
      <p>
        The four elements return to their nature as a child to its mother. Fire is hot, wind moves,
        water is wet, earth hard.
      </p>
      <p>Eyes see, ears hear, nose smells, tongue tastes the salt and sour.</p>
      <p>
        Each is independent of the other; cause and effect must return to the great reality. Like
        leaves that come from the same root.
      </p>
      <p>The words high and low are used relatively.</p>
      <p>
        Within light there is darkness, but do not try to understand that darkness; within darkness
        there is light, but do not look for that light.
      </p>
      <p>
        Light and darkness are a pair, like the foot before and the foot behind, in walking. Each
        thing has its own intrinsic value and is related to everything else in function and
        position.
      </p>
      <p>Ordinary life fits the absolute as a box and its lid.</p>
      <p>
        The absolute works together with the relative, like two arrows meeting in mid-air. Reading
        words you should grasp the great reality. Do not judge by any standards. If you do not see
        the Way, you do not see it even as you walk on it.
      </p>
      <p>When you walk the Way, it is not near, it is not far.</p>
      <p>If you are deluded, you are mountains and rivers away from it.</p>
      <p>
        I respectfully say to those who wish to be enlightened: Do not waste your time by night or
        day.

        He or she who wants to attain peace should practice being upright, humble, and capable of
        using loving speech. He or she will know how to live simply and happily, with senses calmed,
        without being covetous and carried away by the emotions of the majority. Let him or her not
        do anything that will be disapproved of by the wise ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>And this is what he or she contemplates:</strong><br />May everyone be happy and
        safe, and may their hearts be filled with joy.<br />May all living beings live in security
        and peace- beings who are frail or strong, tall or short, big or small, visible or not
        visible, near or far away, already born or yet to be born. May all of them dwell in perfect
        tranquility.<br />Let no one do harm to anyone. Let no one put the life of anyone in danger.
        Let no one, out of anger or ill will, wish anyone any harm.<br />Just as a mother loves and
        protects her only child at the risk of her own life, we should cultivate boundless love to
        offer to all living beings in the entire cosmos. We should let our boundless love pervade
        the whole universe, above, below and across. Our love will know no obstacles; our heart will
        be absolutely free from hatred and enmity. Whether standing or walking, sitting or lying, as
        long as we are awake, we should maintain this mindfulness of love in our own heart.<br />This
        is the noblest way of living. Free from wrong views, greed and sensual desires, living in
        beauty and realizing perfect understanding, those who practice boundless love will certainly
        transcend birth and death.

        Please close your eyes. Allow yourself to be here in this very moment. Bring your attention
        to your breath and let go of all your thoughts, don’t hold onto memories of the past nor
        anticipate the future. Relax into this very moment without any effort, as if you’re floating

      </p>
      <p>
        Now from this place of serenity, visualize all living beings from all realms of existence
        filling the space in front of you. You might like to visualize specific persons, such as
        your parents, relatives and friends or people who caused you harm. You might also like to
        visualize people who are in great need, those who are sick and dying, or suffering from all
        kinds of external and internal adversities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feel that your heart is opening to embrace all of their pain and sorrow as your own. Imagine
        you are taking in their suffering in the form of a dark cloud, which enters through your
        nostrils with your inhalation. Let your heart expand to the limits of the universe with
        empathy for their suffering. Again and again, let your heart be filled with this cloud of
        universal suffering with your incoming breath.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, when we exhale, imagine that you’re sending love, compassion and happiness in the form
        of brilliant rays of golden light which extend to the furthest reaches of the universe and
        enter the hearts and minds of all living being everywhere. Please keep sending this golden
        light with each exhalation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine that everyone without exception is receiving your gift, which results in freeing all
        beings from every form of suffering, and they begin to experience Bodhichitta – the heart of
        boundless love and ecstatic insight.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think that through this generosity, every living being now enjoys complete and perfect

        With the heartfelt desire and determination to attain enlightenment for the welfare of all

        In all actions, may I closely examine my state of mind, and the moment a disturbing emotion
        or negative attitude arises, since this may cause harm to myself and others, may I firmly
        face and avert it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever I meet people of unpleasant character or those overwhelmed by negativity, pain or
        suffering, may I cherish and care for them as if I had found a rare and precious treasure
        difficult to find.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever others, because of their jealousy, treat me badly with abuse, insult, slander, or
        in other unjust ways, may I accept this defeat myself and offer the victory to others.
      </p>
      <p>
        When someone whom I have benefited or in whom I have placed great trust and hope harms me or
        treats me in hurtful ways without reason, may I see that person as my precious teacher.
      </p>
      <p>
        In brief, may I offer both directly and indirectly all help, happiness and benefit to all
        beings, my mothers, and may I secretly take upon myself all of their harmful actions, pain
        and suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
        May I keep all of these practices undefiled by stains of the eight worldly concerns
        (gain/loss, pleasure/pain, praise/blame, fame/dishonor), and by recognizing the emptiness
        and illusory nature of all existing things, may I be liberated from the bondage of
        attachment and mistaken views of reality.

      <p>
        Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of suffering: birth, aging, death, sorrow,
        lamentation, pain, grief, &amp; despair are suffering; association with the unbeloved is
        suffering; separation from the loved is suffering; not getting what is wanted is suffering.
        In short, the five aggregates subject to clinging are suffering.<br />The five aggregates
        consist of form, sensations, perceptions, mental formations (including desires, wishes, and
        tendencies), and consciousness.<br />
        Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the origin of suffering: it is this craving which
        leads to re-becoming, accompanied by delight and lust, seeking delight here and there; that
        is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for becoming, craving for non-becoming.<br />Now
        this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering: understanding the truth of
        life, the fading away and cessation of craving, the giving up and relinquishing of it,
        freedom from it, non-reliance on it.<br />
        Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering: it
        is this Noble Eightfold Path which is nourished by living mindfully. Mindfulness leads to
        concentration and understanding which liberates you from every pain and sorrow and leads to
        peace and joy. I will guide you along this path of realization of right view, right resolve,
        right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right
        concentration.

        <strong>The Noble Eightfold Path </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        is the fourth noble truth, the way to enlightenment. The Buddha taught that we must follow
        this path to overcome ignorance, attachment, and aversion, the root causes of suffering. The
        path consists of eight practices that we should cultivate in our everyday lives. They are:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Right View</strong>: To see clearly the true nature of reality, the four noble
        truths, the law of karma, and the three marks of existence (impermanence, suffering, and
        non-self).<br /><strong>Right Intention</strong>: To have the unselfish desire to realize
        enlightenment for the benefit of all beings, to renounce worldly pleasures and harmful
        thoughts, and to cultivate loving-kindness and compassion.<br /><strong>Right Speech</strong
        >: To use speech wisely and kindly, to avoid lying, slandering, harsh words, and idle
        chatter, and to speak truthfully, respectfully, gently, and beneficially.<br /><strong
          >Right Action</strong
        >: To act ethically and harmlessly, to avoid killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, and
        intoxicants, and to protect life, property, purity, and clarity.<br /><strong
          >Right Livelihood</strong
        >: To earn a living in a way that does not cause harm or suffering to oneself or others, to
        avoid occupations that involve killing, exploiting, cheating, or deceiving, and to engage in
        work that is honest, useful, and supportive of the path.<br /><strong>Right Effort</strong>:
        To apply oneself diligently and energetically to the practice of the path, to prevent and
        overcome unwholesome states of mind, and to develop and maintain wholesome states of
        mind.<br /><strong>Right Mindfulness</strong>: To be aware of the present moment with
        discernment, to observe the body, feelings, mind, and phenomena as they are, without
        attachment or aversion, and to understand their impermanent, suffering, and empty nature.<br /><strong
          >Right Concentration</strong
        >: To train the mind in meditation, to focus on a single object or concept, to attain mental
        stability, clarity, and calmness, and to experience the various stages of absorption and
        insight.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the Noble Eightfold Path of Buddhism. It is the middle way between the extremes of
        indulgence and asceticism. It is the path of wisdom, ethics, and mental discipline. It is
        the path that leads to the cessation of suffering and the realization of nirvana.

        vision and knowledge, which leads to peace, wisdom, enlightenment, and nibbana–the noble
        eightfold path: Right Understanding of suffering of its origin of its cessation of the way
        leading to the cessation of suffering Right Intentions of renunciation, free from craving of
        good will, free from aversion of compassion, free from cruelty Right Speech abstaining from
        false speech abstaining from malicious speech abstaining from harsh speech abstaining from
        useless speech Right Action abstaining from taking life abstaining from stealing abstaining
        from sexual misconduct Right Livelihood giving up wrong livelihood, one earns ones living by
        a right form of livelihood Right Effort to prevent unarisen unwholesome mental states from
        arising to abandon unwholesome mental states that have already arisen to develop wholesome
        mental states that have not yet arisen to maintain and perfect wholesome mental states

        Om Ah Hum (Hung) This is a mantra from the Tibetan tradition, to help us clarify, or purify,
        our Body, Speech, and Mind. Mantras are sounds and phrases that can help us concentrate our
        minds. We can use mantras as a way to concentrate on a given intention. This mantra can be
        seen as a means of helping us focus our intentions to clarify, or purify, our body, speech,
        and mind. We can regard ourselves while we chant as asking our own being, the parts of us
        that put up blocks and barricades to real contentment, to let our better parts, our pure,
        good intentions, get stronger, shine through, and help us let go. OM stands for the body, AH
        for the speech, and HUM (or HUNG) for the mind. They represent the possibility of
        transformative blessings of the body, speech, and mind from all the Buddhas— past, present,
        and future. In chanting OM we are asking ourselves to purify, to release all guilt and
        shame, of all the negative actions committed through our body, and we commit to an intention
        to do better in the future. In chanting AH we are asking ourselves to purify, to release all
        guilt and shame, of all the negative actions committed through our speech, and we commit to
        an intention to do better in the future. In chanting HUM we are asking ourselves to purify,
        to release all guilt and shame of all the negative actions committed through our mind, and
        we commit to an intention to do better in the future. OM is also said to be the essence of
        form, AH the essence of sound, and HUM the essence of mind. So by reciting this mantra, you
        are also purifying the environment, as well as yourself and all other beings within it. OM
        purifies all perceptions, AH all sounds, and HUM the mind, its thoughts and its emotions.

        (Three bells) Read by all: The Dharma is deep and lovely. We now have a chance to see it,
        study it, and practice it. We vow to realize its true meaning. (Bell) Said by the leader of
        the ceremony: Today the community has gathered to recite and practice the sutras, invoking
        the Buddhas’ and bodhisattvas’ names, to make offerings, and to transfer the merits to
        [Name(s) of deceased]. We ask the community to listen with a quiet mind . Parents and
        grandparents, whether they have left this life or not, are present in their children and
        grandchildren . The life of the ancestors carries on in the lives of children and
        grandchildren . According to the Buddha, the peace and joy of the children and grandchildren
        are the peace and joy of the parents, grandparents and all ancestors . With a feeling of
        calm, clarity and peace, we will make possible the calm, clarity and peace of those who have
        left this life . Let us all recite the Contemplation on No-Coming and No-Going. Recited by
        all present: This body is not me. I am not limited by this body. I am life without
        boundaries. I have never been born, and I have never died. . We meet today. We will meet
        again tomorrow. We will meet at the source of every moment. We will meet each other in all
        forms of life. (Bell) Incense perfumes the atmosphere . A lotus blooms, and the Buddha
        appears . The world of suffering and discrimination is filled with the light of the Rising
        Sun . As the dust of fear and anxiety settles, with an open heart and one-pointed mind I
        turn to the three jewels . (Bell) (continued next page) (Ceremonies for Our Deceased Loved
        Ones continued) The Fully Enlightened One, beautifully seated, peaceful and smiling, a
        loving source of understanding and compassion: To the Buddha I go for refuge . (Bell) The
        path of mindful living, leading to healing, joy and enlightenment, the way of peace: To the
        Dharma I go for refuge . (Bell) The loving and supportive community of practice, realizing
        harmony, awareness, and liberation: To the Sangha I go for refuge . (Bell) I am aware that
        the three Gems are within my heart; I vow to realize them, practicing mindful breathing,
        smiling, and looking deeply into things. I vow to understand living beings and their
        suffering. I vow to cultivate loving kindness and compassion and to practice joy and
        equanimity. (Bell) I vow to offer joy to one person in the morning, and to help relieve the
        grief of one person in the afternoon. I vow to live simply and sanely with few possessions,
        and to keep my body healthy. I vow to let go of all worries and anxiety in order to be light
        and free. (Bell) I am aware that I owe much to my parents, teachers, friends, spouse and all
        beings. I vow to practice wholeheartedly so that understanding and compassion will flower,
        empowering living beings to be free from suffering. May the Buddha, the Dharma, and the
        Sangha support my efforts.

      <h2 id="green-tara"><strong>Green Tara Visualization and Mantra Recitation</strong></h2>
      <p>
        In the space before you, on a lotus and moon disc appears green Tara. Her body is made of
        green light, transparent like a rainbow. Her left leg is drawn up in lotus posture to
        symbolize control over desire. Her right leg is extended, symbolizing that she is ready to
        rise to the aid of all beings. Her left hand is at her heart in the gesture of giving
        refuge: the palm facing outward, thumb & ring finger touching, the other fingers raised. Her
        right hand is on her right knee, in the gesture of giving high realizations: the palm faces
        outwards, thumb & index finger touching, the other fingers pointing down. Both hands hold a
        blue lotus flower . She is very beautiful, dressed in celestial silks, and smiles at you .
        Think of your problems, needs and aims and request Tara’s help from your heart. Then she
        shines white light from her forehead into your forehead, eliminating problems and
        negativities of your body.
        <br />OM TARE TUTTARE TURE SOHA Next she shines red light from her throat into your throat,
        eliminating obstacles and negativities of your speech. OM TARE TUTTARE TURE SOHA Next she
        shines blue light from her heart into your heart, eliminating all obstacles and negativities
        of your mind. <br />OM TARE TUTTARE TURE SOHA Try to feel you are now free from all
        hindrances and problems, and that you have received the inspiration and energy to accomplish
        your aims. Then Tara comes to the crown of your head, facing the same way as you. She
        dissolves into green light, which descends into your heart center. Your mind merges with
        Tara’s mind. Keep this feeling as long as possible.
