    <h2 id="the-heart-sutra-tibetan"><strong>The Heart Sutra – Tibetan</strong> &nbsp;<a routerLink="." fragment="toc" title="Back to top" class="back-to-top">↑</a></h2>

    <p>Thus have I heard: Once the Blessed One was dwelling in Rajagriha at Vulture Peak Mountain with a great gathering
      of monks, nuns and Bodhisattvas. At that time the Blessed One entered the samadhi that expresses the dharma
      called “Profound Illumination.” At the same time, noble Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva Mahasattva, while
      engaging in the profound transcendent wisdom, clearly saw the five skandhas to be empty of nature. Then, through
      the inspiration of the Buddha, venerable Shariputra said to noble Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva Mahasattva,
      “How should a son or daughter of noble family train, who wishes to follow the profound path of transcendent
      wisdom?”<br>Then noble Avalokiteshvara, a Bodhisattva Mahasattva, said to venerable Shariputra: “O Shariputra, a
      son or daughter of noble family who wishes to follow the profound path of transcendent wisdom should see in this
      way: See the five skandhas to be empty of nature. Form is emptiness. Emptiness is form. Emptiness is no other
      than form; form is no other than emptiness. In the same way, feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness
      are emptiness.<br>“Thus, Shariputra, all phenomena are emptiness. They have no characteristics. There is no birth
      and no cessation. There is no impurity and no purity. There is no decrease and no increase. Therefore,
      Shariputra, in emptiness, there is no form, no feeling, no perception, no formation, no consciousness; no eye, no
      ear, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind; no appearance, no sound, no smell, no taste, no touch, no phenomena; no
      quality of sight, and so on until no quality of thought and no quality of mind-consciousness; no ignorance, no end
      of ignorance up to no old age and death, no end of old age and death; no suffering, no cause of suffering, no
      cessation of suffering and no path; no wisdom, no attainment and no non-attainment. Therefore, Shariputra, since
      the Bodhisattvas have no attainment, they abide by means of transcendent wisdom. Since there is no obscuration of
      mind, there is no fear. They transcend falsity and attain complete nirvana, passing beyond the bounds of sorrow.
      All the Buddhas of the three times, by means of transcendent wisdom, fully and<br>clearly awaken to unsurpassable,
      true, complete enlightenment. Therefore, the great mantra of transcendent wisdom, the mantra of great insight,
      the unsurpassed mantra, the mantra that equals the unequaled, the mantra that calms all suffering, should be known
      as truth, since there is no deception. The mantra of transcendent wisdom is said in this way: <br>‘OM GATE GATE
      PARAGATE PARASAMGATE BODHI SVAHA’<br>“Thus, Shariputra, the Bodhisattva Mahasattvas should train in the
      profound<br>transcendent wisdom.” Then the Blessed One arose from that samadhi and praised noble Avalokiteshvara,
      the Bodhisattva Mahasattva, saying, “Good, good. Thus it is, O son of noble family, thus it is. One should practice
      the profound transcendent wisdom just as you have taught and all the Tathagatas will rejoice.” When the Blessed
      One had said this, venerable Shariputra and noble Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva Mahasattva, that whole assembly
      and the world with its gods, humans, asuras and gandharvas, rejoiced and praised the words of the Blessed One.</p>

      <h2 id="the-prajnaparamita-heart-sutra">The Prajnaparamita Heart Sutra: &nbsp;<a routerLink="." fragment="toc" title="Back to top" class="back-to-top">↑</a></h2>

      <p>When the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara was coursing in the deep prajnaparamita, <br>he perceived that all five
        skandhas are empty, thereby transcending all sufferings.</p>

      <p>Sariputra, form is not other than emptiness and emptiness not other than form.<br>Form is precisely emptiness
        and emptiness precisely form.<br>So also are sensation, perception, volition, and consciousness.<br>Sariputra,
        this voidness of all dharmas is not born, not destroyed, <br>not impure, not pure, does not increase or
        decrease.</p>

      <p>In voidness there is no form, and no sensation, <br>perception, volition or consciousness;<br>no eye, ear, nose,
        tongue, body, mind;<br>no sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, thought;<br>there is no realm of the eye, all the
        way up to no realm of mental cognition.</p>

      <div>
        <p>There is no ignorance and there is no ending of ignorance,<br>through to no aging and death and no ending of
          aging and death.<br>There is no suffering, no cause of suffering, no cessation of suffering, and no
          path.<br>There is no wisdom or any attainment.<br>With nothing to attain, bodhisattvas relying on
          prajnaparamita have no obstructions in their minds.<br>Having no obstructions, there is no fear and departing
          far from confusion and imagining, they reach ultimate nirvana.<br><br>All past, present and future Buddhas,
          <br>relying on prajnaparamita, attain anuttara-samyak-sambodhi.<br>Therefore, know that prajnaparamita is the
          great mantra of power, <br>the great mantra of wisdom, the supreme mantra, the unequalled mantra, <br>which is
          able to remove all sufferings. It is real and not false.<br>Therefore, recite the mantra of prajnaparamita:<br><br>Gate,
          Gate. Paragate. Parasamgate. Bodhi Svaha.</p>

      <p>Thus, have I heard Avalokitesvara, the Bodhisattva Majasattva, while practicing the prajna-paramita, clearly saw
        all phenomena to be empty of nature.</p>

      <p>Listen Sariputra! Form is emptiness and emptiness is form. Emptiness is no other than form and form is no other
        than emptiness. All phenomena are empty of any characteristics, or inherent or intrinsic qualities.</p>

      <p>In emptiness there is no birth and no death, no impurity, no purity, no increase, no decrease, no feeling,
        perception, formation, or consciousness.</p>

      <p>No eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind, sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, no objects of mind; no realms of the
        eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind-consciousness.</p>

      <p>Sariputra, there is no ignorance, and no ending of ignorance. There are no actions and no non-actions. No
        actions like walking, chanting, thinking, feeling, or perceiving.</p>

      <p>There is no intention, and no paying attention, no choosing and non-choosing. There is no consciousness, no
        awareness of thoughts, emotions, sensations, and no cessation of awareness, thoughts and emotions.</p>

      <p>Sariputra, there are no forms and no names for these forms, no labels, no designations, no characteristics or
        appearance of things and also no things.&nbsp;There are no six sense organs, nor contact with the senses. Thus,
        no sensation, no desire, no grasping, no existence, no birth, no aging, no old age and no death; also, no ending
        to birth, existence, aging and death.</p>

      <p>There is no suffering, no cause of suffering, no cessation of suffering and no path. There is no wisdom and no
        attainment. Therefore, with nothing to attain, bodhisattvas realize the ultimate nature of reality, transcening
        all words and concepts, all hindrences and vexations, they abide in the perfection of wisdom, the
        prajna-paramita.</p>

      <p>Having no more hindrances in their mind, they have no fear. They transcend all illusion and delusion, and dwell
        in complete and ultimate nirvana. All buddhas of the past, present and future rely on prajna-paramita to fully
        and completely awaken. Therefore, we honor the prajna-paramita with a great transcendent mantra, the great
        mantra of insight, the supreme mantra, the unequalled mantra, the mantra that can end all suffering and since
        there is no deception it is known as truth. So let us recite the prajna-paramita mantra in this way:</p>

      <p>Om gate, gate, paragate, parasamgate, bodhi, svaha!&nbsp;</p>

    <p>He or she who wants to attain peace should practice being upright, humble, and capable of using loving speech. He
      or she will know how to live simply and happily, with senses calmed, without being covetous and carried away by
      the emotions of the majority. Let him or her not do anything that will be disapproved of by the wise ones.</p>

    <p><strong>And this is what he or she contemplates:</strong><br>May everyone be happy and safe, and may their hearts
      be filled with joy.<br>May all living beings live in security and peace- beings who are frail or strong, tall or
      short, big or small, visible or not visible, near or far away, already born or yet to be born. May all of them
      dwell in perfect tranquility.<br>Let no one do harm to anyone. Let no one put the life of anyone in danger. Let no
      one, out of anger or ill will, wish anyone any harm.<br>Just as a mother loves and protects her only child at the
      risk of her own life, we should cultivate boundless love to offer to all living beings in the entire cosmos. We
      should let our boundless love pervade the whole universe, above, below and across. Our love will know no
      obstacles; our heart will be absolutely free from hatred and enmity. Whether standing or walking, sitting or
      lying, as long as we are awake, we should maintain this mindfulness of love in our own heart.<br>This is the
      noblest way of living. Free from wrong views, greed and sensual desires, living in beauty and realizing perfect
      understanding, those who practice boundless love will certainly transcend birth and death.</p>

    <p> Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of suffering: birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief,
      &amp; despair are suffering; association with the unbeloved is suffering; separation from the loved is suffering;
      not getting what is wanted is suffering. In short, the five aggregates subject to clinging are suffering.<br>The
      five aggregates consist of form, sensations, perceptions, mental formations (including desires, wishes, and
      tendencies), and consciousness.<br> Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the origin of suffering: it is this
      craving which leads to re-becoming, accompanied by delight and lust, seeking delight here and there; that is,
      craving for sensual pleasures, craving for becoming, craving for non-becoming.<br>Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble
      truth of the cessation of suffering: understanding the truth of life, the fading away and cessation of craving,
      the giving up and relinquishing of it, freedom from it, non-reliance on it.<br> Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble
      truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering: it is this Noble Eightfold Path which is nourished by
      living mindfully. Mindfulness leads to concentration and understanding which liberates you from every pain and
      sorrow and leads to peace and joy. I will guide you along this path of realization of right view, right resolve,
      right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.</p>

    <h2 id="the-noble-eightfold-path"><strong>The Noble Eightfold Path </strong> &nbsp;<a routerLink="." fragment="toc" title="Back to top" class="back-to-top">↑</a></h2>

    <p>is the fourth noble truth, the way to enlightenment. The Buddha taught that we must follow this path to overcome
      ignorance, attachment, and aversion, the root causes of suffering. The path consists of eight practices that we
      should cultivate in our everyday lives. They are:</p>

    <p><strong>Right View</strong>: To see clearly the true nature of reality, the four noble truths, the law of karma,
      and the three marks of existence (impermanence, suffering, and non-self).<br><strong>Right Intention</strong>: To
      have the unselfish desire to realize enlightenment for the benefit of all beings, to renounce worldly pleasures
      and harmful thoughts, and to cultivate loving-kindness and compassion.<br><strong>Right Speech</strong>: To use
      speech wisely and kindly, to avoid lying, slandering, harsh words, and idle chatter, and to speak truthfully,
      respectfully, gently, and beneficially.<br><strong>Right Action</strong>: To act ethically and harmlessly, to
      avoid killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants, and to protect life, property, purity, and
      clarity.<br><strong>Right Livelihood</strong>: To earn a living in a way that does not cause harm or suffering to
      oneself or others, to avoid occupations that involve killing, exploiting, cheating, or deceiving, and to engage
      in work that is honest, useful, and supportive of the path.<br><strong>Right Effort</strong>: To apply oneself
      diligently and energetically to the practice of the path, to prevent and overcome unwholesome states of mind, and
      to develop and maintain wholesome states of mind.<br><strong>Right Mindfulness</strong>: To be aware of the present
      moment with discernment, to observe the body, feelings, mind, and phenomena as they are, without attachment or
      aversion, and to understand their impermanent, suffering, and empty nature.<br><strong>Right
        Concentration</strong>: To train the mind in meditation, to focus on a single object or concept, to attain
      mental stability, clarity, and calmness, and to experience the various stages of absorption and insight.</p>

    <p>This is the Noble Eightfold Path of Buddhism. It is the middle way between the extremes of indulgence and
      asceticism. It is the path of wisdom, ethics, and mental discipline. It is the path that leads to the cessation of
      suffering and the realization of nirvana.</p>
