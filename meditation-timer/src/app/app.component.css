       The "stack them" likely referred to sliders.
       However, memory says "On mobile screens (<600px), the Help and Donate buttons... shift to the bottom-right, stack vertically".
       Since they are now in the footer, maybe side-by-side is better for height?
       But let's look at the request: "header shifts... can we try creating a footer... and move the buttons to the footer".
       The user didn't explicitly say "stack buttons in footer".
       I'll keep them side-by-side in footer for compactness unless space is tight.
